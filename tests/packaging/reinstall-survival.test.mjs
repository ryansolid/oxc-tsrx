/**
 * "If it doesn't survive install it's useless."
 *
 * This file is that sentence as a test. A consumer installs this package, runs
 * `setup` exactly once, and then does the ordinary things people do to a
 * dependency graph: add something, remove something, install again, install
 * again from the frozen lockfile, rebuild. After every one of those, with
 * `setup` never run again, the editor must still resolve `.tsrx` linting to a
 * binary inside `node_modules/@tsrx/oxc`.
 *
 * The one mechanism this test is forbidden from leaning on is
 * `node_modules/.bin/oxlint`. pnpm 10.33 rewrites that shim on install,
 * `--frozen-lockfile`, `add`, `remove` and `rebuild`, and in a Vite+ tree it
 * does not belong to this package in the first place. So the fixture ships a
 * synthetic collider that declares `bin.oxlint` and `bin.oxfmt` and wins pnpm's
 * tie-break, exactly as Vite+ does. Every read of `.bin/oxlint` below asserts
 * that the shim is *not* ours: they are there to prove that whatever keeps
 * working, it is not the shim.
 *
 * What is left is the `oxc.path.oxlint` key in `.vscode/settings.json` plus the
 * `@tsrx/oxc` dependency itself, and the oracle in
 * `packages/toolchain/dist/editor-resolution.js` is what says whether that pair
 * would really make the official OXC extension spawn our linter.
 *
 * The last subtest is the important one. It deletes the key, then rewrites the
 * key to point at the collider, and asserts that the survival check *fails*
 * both times, then restores it and asserts it passes again. A reinstall test
 * that cannot fail when the wiring breaks is worth nothing.
