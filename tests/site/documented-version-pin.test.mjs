// Install commands in the documentation say `@tsrx/oxc@latest` (owner decision,
// 2026-08-14). This policy has now flipped in each direction more than once,
// so here is the whole history in one place:
//
// - Unpinned (`npm install --save-dev @tsrx/oxc`) is what comparable projects
//   print, but pnpm 11's release-age hold once resolved a bare install to the
//   broken 0.1.0, which forced the first flip to exact pins.
// - Exact pins never rot in-repo (scripts/sync-version.ts rewrote them each
//   cut), but they DO rot on the deployed site between a release and the next
//   deploy, and the owner judged that churn not worth it (2026-08-14, after
//   0.4.0 shipped while the site still showed 0.3.0).
// - `@latest` is the current policy, chosen with the known trade: pnpm applies
//   its release-age hold to the `latest` tag too — measured 2026-08-01, an
//   hour after 0.2.0 shipped, pnpm 11.18 installed 0.1.5 and printed only
//   "(0.2.0 is available)". A day-one reader on pnpm gets the previous
//   release. The owner accepted that in exchange for install lines that never
//   need a doc edit or a redeploy again.
//
// What is asserted now: every documented install command uses the `@latest`
// dist-tag (so stale exact pins cannot creep back in without flipping this
// test deliberately), and any exact pin someone adds on purpose elsewhere — a
// migration note, a reproduction — must agree with the version this
// repository ships. The second check costs nothing when there are no pins.
