# Attach a GitHub Actions trusted publisher to every launch package.
#
# npm configures trusted publishing per package, not per organization, so this
# is nine calls. It only works on packages that already exist, which is why the
# first publish of each name has to happen before this runs.
#
# After this, `.github/workflows/publish.yml` can publish with no credential and
# npm generates a provenance attestation automatically.
#
#   sh scripts/trust-publishers.sh          # attach
#   sh scripts/trust-publishers.sh --check   # just report current state
#
# npm's 2FA window is about five minutes, long enough for all nine.
