# Platform and ABI policy

OXC for TSRX ships one generated npm package per supported native ABI. The
runtime selects exactly one package from `process.platform`, `process.arch`, and
Linux libc. It validates package version, protocol version, OXC revision,
target identity, executable declaration, and executable mode before launching.
There is no download-on-install script and no fallback to a similar-looking
ABI.

The two Arm GitHub labels are currently public-preview runner infrastructure.
That does not weaken artifact checks: those jobs are required in the release
matrix, run on the matching architecture, and a missing runner/build blocks the
candidate. A release may not omit an advertised optional dependency.

## Compatibility floors

- Native releases are built with Rust 1.95.0 and the committed `Cargo.lock`.
  Rust is a build input, not a user runtime dependency.
- GNU/Linux builds use Ubuntu 22.04. The workflow records the highest referenced
  `GLIBC_*` symbol and rejects anything newer than `GLIBC_2.35`.
- musl builds use Rust's musl targets and must be statically linked. They are a
  distinct npm package, never a fallback selected for glibc hosts or vice versa.
- macOS arm64 sets `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0`; macOS x64 sets `10.15`.
- Windows artifacts use the MSVC ABI on matching x64 or arm64 Windows runners.
- Release compilation uses Rust's target baseline. `target-cpu=native` and
  runner-specific CPU features are forbidden in distributed artifacts.
- The JavaScript boundary supports Node `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`. CI exercises
  20.19.0, 22.12.0, and a maintained 24.x LTS release.
- The editor manifest declares VS Code `^1.95.0`.

Changing any floor is a compatibility decision, not routine CI maintenance. It
requires a documented rationale, clean installs on the old and new boundary
where possible, and a semver decision before release.

## Artifact contents

Each `@tsrx/oxc-*` platform tarball contains:

- `oxc-tsrx`, one multi-call executable that carries the linter, the formatter,
  and the language server and selects one by subcommand (`fmt`, `lsp`, or the
  default `lint`) or by the name it was invoked under;
- a machine-readable checksum/target/OXC manifest; and
- the project, OXC, and locked dependency legal material.

Each platform VSIX embeds only `oxc-tsrx` plus its manifest, checksum, and
legal material, and starts it with the `lsp` subcommand. It must not embed the lint CLI, format CLI, `node_modules`, a
second platform binary, a Cargo checkout, or an OXC source tree.

The platform-independent packages contain only their declared JavaScript
runtime surface and documentation. They have exact same-version dependencies
on the runtime/native set, no postinstall script, and `preferUnplugged` on the
native packages so package managers do not try to execute binaries from an
archive.

## Verification rules

The release workflow builds on a matching OS and CPU. The packager executes all
three tool identities of the single binary on a matching native target and
checks each one's exact version/OXC identity. A musl target is also executed on its same-architecture Linux host
after static-link verification. Every output receives SHA-256 metadata, and the
assembled candidate receives a deterministic sorted checksum list.

Before packing, the JavaScript packager reads each executable header directly
and requires a 64-bit Mach-O, ELF, or PE image matching the declared OS and
x64/arm64 architecture. This does not execute a shell `file` heuristic and
works for cross artifacts. Linux libc is a separate ABI property: the release
workflow inspects every GNU binary's highest `GLIBC_*` reference and requires
every musl binary to be static, then executes all three on the matching
same-architecture runner.

Cross-platform packaging is release evidence; it is not full runtime evidence
for every operating-system version. Before changing support claims, retain a
real clean-install transcript for that ABI. A report produced through a binary
override, `NODE_PATH`, source-tree `target/release`, or a mismatched native
package is invalid.

Unsupported OS, CPU, or libc combinations must fail with an actionable error.
They must never delegate `.tsrx` to official Oxlint/Oxfmt or silently skip files.
