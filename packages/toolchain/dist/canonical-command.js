/**
* Arbitration for the canonical command names this package also publishes.
*
* `oxc-tsrx` ships `oxlint` and `oxfmt` bins because that is the only thing
* that makes a plain `npm install @tsrx/oxc` reach released hosts: the installer
* links `node_modules/.bin/oxlint`, and the released `oxc.oxc-vscode`
* extension probes exactly that path first. Nothing else about the shipped
* artifact reaches an unmodified host.
*
* The cost is a name collision. When a project *also* declares the official
* `oxlint` or `oxfmt` package, whichever package wins `node_modules/.bin` is
* decided by the installer, and installers disagree: npm 11 links this
* package's launcher and pnpm 10 links the official one. Measured for T016.
*
* So the launcher decides for itself instead of inheriting the race. A direct
* dependency on the official package in the project's own manifest is an
* explicit statement about what that command name means, and it wins: the
* launcher hands the whole invocation to the exact binary that package
* declares. The observable behaviour of `oxlint`/`oxfmt` in such a project is
* then identical under every installer, and identical to what it was before
* `oxc-tsrx` was added.
*
* A transitive official package (Vite+ depends on `oxlint`, for instance) is
* not such a statement, so it does not take the command name away.

*

*
* `spawnCommand` covers the other branch: a declared `bin` may be a `.cmd` or
* `.bat` launcher, which only a command interpreter can run. See
* ./spawn-command.js for why that is done inline and without `shell: true`.
*
* A spawn that never starts is reported rather than thrown as an unhandled
